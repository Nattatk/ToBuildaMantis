Please, look at me again! It's been nearly my whole life since I've seen your eyes look into mine!
Nature, oh Nature! Recognize my existence! I repent for my ancestor's sins and the destruction
they wrought upon you. Forgive me! I promise a devoted life towards your restoration...
just please... look at me again... I can't be destruction without life to destroy.
